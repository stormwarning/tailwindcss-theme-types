# tailwindcss-types-cli

> A CLI to generate type declarations from your Tailwind CSS classes.

## Usage

This doesn't run PurgeCSS before compiling the list of classes â€” make sure the
output file is not included in the files PurgeCSS checks or it will find *all*
the class strings and purge nothing, giving you a massive CSS file.
